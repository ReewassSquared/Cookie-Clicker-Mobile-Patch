# Cookie Clicker Mobile Patch
A modified version of Orteil's Cookie Clicker android app, currently based on the alpha v6 early access version.

### DISCLAIMER
Orteil reserves the rights and ownership of all code in this repository.

### How to Build
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Use apktool to build from the source (apktool and the instructions for how to install it can be found [here](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/))
3. You're done, it's that easy :)

### Features
Major bug fixes:
- Any upgrade can now be used in the permanent upgrade slots.

Additions:
- A wrinkler GUI in the special tab that shows how many active wrinklers you have and also has a button to pop all wrinklers (it wont pop shiny wrinklers).

New settings:
- Short Numbers - Shorten big numbers using english notation (default: on)
- Short Formatting - Shorten the notation of cookies in bank (default: on)
- Development Tools - Allows for the use of development tools (default: off)

### Planned Features
- Add a "Round to 3dp" setting, which would allow the user to toggle the rounding of all large numbers between 1 and 3 decimal places.
- Add a "Spread Wrinklers" setting, which would make wrinklers spread around the big cookie instead of clustering to one side (would only work if your resolution is high enough so that they can all fit on screen).

### Thanks
Thanks to Trixter for allowing this project to use code from his permanent upgrade slot bug fix patch.
Of course, thanks to Orteil for creating this amazing game :)
